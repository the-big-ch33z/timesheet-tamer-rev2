Welcome to the Time Utilities documentation. This collection of documents provides comprehensive information about our time utilities library, how to use it, and the architecture behind it.

## Table of Contents

### Architecture

- [Time Utilities Architecture](./architecture/TimeUtilitiesArchitecture.md) - Overview of the architecture and components

### Implementation Guide

- [Implementation Timeline](./implementation/ImplementationTimeline.md) - Timeline and phases for implementing the refactoring

### Usage Guides

- [Time Utilities Patterns](./patterns/TimeUtilitiesPatterns.md) - Common patterns for working with time utilities
- [Time Utilities Examples](./examples/TimeUtilitiesExamples.md) - Code examples for various scenarios

### Migration Help

- [Time Utilities Migration](./migration/TimeUtilitiesMigration.md) - Guide for migrating from the old to new system

## Quick Start

For developers new to the time utilities library, we recommend starting with:

1. Read the [Architecture Documentation](./architecture/TimeUtilitiesArchitecture.md) for an overview
2. See [Common Patterns](./patterns/TimeUtilitiesPatterns.md) for how to use the library
3. Check [Examples](./examples/TimeUtilitiesExamples.md) for specific use cases
4. If migrating from the old system, refer to the [Migration Guide](./migration/TimeUtilitiesMigration.md)

## Core Concepts

The time utilities library is built around these core concepts:

1. **Centralization** - All time-related functionality is centralized in one place
2. **Separation of Concerns** - Clear separation between utilities, services, and React components
3. **Hooks-Based API** - React components interact with utilities through custom hooks
4. **Standardized Error Handling** - Consistent approach to handling errors in time operations
5. **Testing Coverage** - Comprehensive testing for all aspects of the library

For any questions or feedback, please contact the architecture team.
